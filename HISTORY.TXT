***   VirtuaWin Revision History   ***
--------------------------------------
Ver 2.7 2003/04/09
* Double click on the icon will bring up setup, a select "disable" instead for disabling.
* Added config options to disable taskbar detection and the alternative hiding technique.
* Bugfix: All windows was shown in the window menu if only one menu was used
* Bugfix: Added retries to add the systray icon incase VirtuaWin starts up before 
  the sytray process.
* Added a new setup tab, "expert" and moved some settings from misc.
* Bugfix: Old taskbar position was not deleted if taskbar position moved during operation. 
  Also improved left/right/up/down taskbar position detection
* Bugfix: The "tricky" windows was not moved away far enough from the screen so you could 
  see a small grey bar at the screen bottom.
* Bugfix: Changed the wait time for module startup timeout to 10 secs instead of 5 to avoid 
  module errors during startup.
----------------------------

Ver 2.6.2 2002/10/01
* Bugfix: Fixed a memory leak
* Bugfix: Added mutex protection for the window list to increase robustness
* Bugfix: Fixed so that the recovery file is written with correct endlines

----------------------------

Ver 2.6.1 2002/07/17 
* Removed the MF_POPUP flag from the window menus since they shouldn't be created like this. 
  Fixed by Ulf Jaenicke-Roesler.
* Improved the window menus so that unnecessary menus and items won't show and they all 
  have a label. Fixes by Ulf Jaencke-Roessler.
* Fixed so that window coordinates are reloaded when resolution is changed, and also 
  so that taskbar location is reloaded if moved.
* Now we try to locate the MSTaskSwWClass even if it is a direct child of Shell_TrayWnd, 
  this will make it work on more windows version and hopefully get rid of the startup error
  some users have experienced.
----------------------------

Ver 2.6 2002/06/02 
* Bugfix: Alternative way of hiding windows. This solves the disappearing 
  Explorer bug

* Classname will now always be "VirtuaWinMainClass" and not version dependent
----------------------------

Ver 2.5 2001/02/10
* Bugfix: Too many modules would corrupt data and cause undefined behavior,
  also increased the maximum number of modules handled from 5 to 10
* Bugfix: Fixed a bug with the username lookup for config file, could go wrong sometimes
* Bugfix: Fixed so that config update notification is sent upon apply and 
  only when something has changed upon hitting ok
* Bugfix: Fixed the sticky symbol in the winlist again, got lost during some changes
* Bugfix: Fixed bug with needing to have hot keys enabled for menu keys to work and 
  also better error message
* The WinList module now has classname for all applications
* Config file will also be written upon every apply and not if cancel is selected
* Added module message for getting the current desktop number
* Modules will now get a notification when desktop layout has changed since we 
  might have a new current desktop number after a change
* The question mark in the setup dialog is removed since it is no functionality for it
----------------------------

Ver 2.4 2000/08/19
* Bugfix: Added the code again that removes closed windows, this will avoid having closed 
  child windows reappearing again. This fix has the disadvantage of being able to remove 
  valid windows when under heavy load, see next item for more info on a workaround
* Added a module, WinList, in the installation package. This module has a list of all 
  windows on the system and can restore any of them if VirtuaWin should loose them
* Modifications by Matti Jagula <matti@proekspert.ee> List of modifications follows: 
  Added window title sorting in popup menus (Assign, Direct, Sticky) Added some controls 
  to Setup Misc tab and support for calling the popup menus from keyboard
* Modifications by Alasdair McCaig. Added multiple user setup support. There will now be 
  one config file for each user
----------------------------

Ver 2.3 2000/06/08
* The system tray icon will be reinstalled if Windows shell is restarted (only with IE4.0 or higher)
* The "switch minimized" option is checked by default (too many questions about why
  not minimized windows where moved)
* Top sticky window will become active if no other active candidate when moving to another desktop
* Bugfix: VirtuaWin could loose windows under heavy load. This should have been fixed now
* Bugfix: Windows can not be assigned to an unavailable desktop (when using desktop assignment)
----------------------------

Ver 2.2.1 2000/03/21 
* Bugfix: Mouse support did not work on win98
----------------------------

Ver 2.2 2000/03/19 
* Added two hotkeys for cycling desktop-number up and down.
* Removed the mousedll. Mouse handling works a little bit different now. This has solved 
  several problems and the only real drawback is that it is not possible to have 0 mouse delay
  anymore, current minimum is 50. Most fixes below come from this mouse change.
* Mouse functionality is totaly disabled when not used. This means that it consumes no CPU time for
  users that disables mouse support.
* Possible to set mouse delay in 50ms precision. 
* Bugfix: Not possible to switch away screensaver locks anymore.
* Bugfix: No unistall problem due to mousedll.dll
* Bugfix: When switching desk with mouse sometimes caused several undesired switches.
* Bugfix: ':' is used as comment character in userlist.cfg instead since some classnames 
  started with '#'.
* Bugfix: Changed display order so that window order should not be moved in the taskbar
* Bugfix: No switching to the same desktop, this will take away any flicker if hotkey 
  to current desk is pressed.
* Bugfix: No warning message if desktopsize isn't really changed in number of desktops.
* Bugfix: Minor change with hotkey routine, might fix some strange hotkey problems.
----------------------------

Ver 2.1.1 2000/02/23 
* Bugfix: The window menus "access" and "assign" did not show if used alone. This only 
  seemed to happen on NT4, not on win9x and 2000. Fixed by Klaus Gassner. 
----------------------------

Ver 2.1 2000/02/16
 * VirtuaWin can now remember desktop belongings upon restart!
 * Possible to have any combination of window menu functionality, not just one as before
 * Button for saving sticky configuration, not just upon exit
 * Some GUI changes under the misc. setup tab.
 * VirtuaWin will timeout if an application has crashed. The system tray icon will flash five times
   if an application is not responding when changing desktop and the application will be ignored.
 * Source code is more organized for easier handling and binary is linked without
   debugging symbols, making it almost half the size
 * Bugfix: Module enable/disable did not work properly with several modules
 * Bugfix: Save sticky on exit did not work if VirtuaWin was shutdown by Windows shutdown/restart.
 * Bugfix: Disabled modules were not saved if VirtuaWin was shutdown by Windows shutdown/restart.
 * Bugfix: Documentation correction regarding MOD_CHANGEDESK w/lParam in Messages.h
 * Bugfix: VirtuaWin tried to switch an invalid window upon every desktop change,
   this fix will probably save a clock cycle or two :)
