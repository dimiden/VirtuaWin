Description
--------------------------------------------------------------
This is a small, fast and easy to use virtual desktop manager for 
Windows9x/ME/NT/2000/XP with no unnecessary features. 
It indicates current desktop in the system tray for saving space. 
A lot of configuration possibilities for both mouse and key control.
It also supports modules for adding features without decreasing performance 
in VirtuaWin itself.


Code comments
--------------------------------------------------------------
I use the gcc compiler for this project with MINGW addon.
It should be possible to compile with other win32 C compilers with 
perhaps minor changes.

Check my website for info on module development.
