VWPreview v1.0 - Steven Phillips

Description:

This VirtuaWin  module creates a preview of all desktops in either a window or
full screen mode allowing the user to see all their desktops. Left clicking on
a desktop will change to that desktop, right  clicking  anywhere will open the
module's  setup dialog. The Tab,  Shift+Tab and Enter keys can also be used to
change desktops, Esc closes the preview. The module requires VirtuaWin version
4.2 or above.


Installation:

Copy VWPreview.exe into the VirtuaWin modules directory.


Notes:

* The module supports 2 modes, Desktop Preview which uses the whole screen and
  Desktop Select which uses a standard window (size is configurable).
* The module has not been  tested on  multiple  monitor  systems and while the
  author does not  envisage any  particularly  nasty  problems the full screen
  preview is unlikely to work well.
* Desktops  which have not yet been  visited will be rendered  blank using the
  background colour, if a background image is being used the background colour
  is typically  black which can make the preview  display rather  unhelpful. A
  future  enhancement  would be to initialise these desktops to the background
  image instead.
* If one of the modes is not being used it is  recommended  that the hotkey is
  removed and option to "Add option into  VirtuaWin  Control Menu" is disabled
  as this may  improve  the quality of the preview  image (a single  image per
  desktop  is used for both modes so the images  must be scaled for one of the
  modes).
