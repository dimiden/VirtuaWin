VWDesktopIcons v1.1 - Steven Phillips

Description:

This  VirtuaWin  module  enables the user to select  which  desktop  icons are
visible and set their position on each VirtuaWin desktop. This module requires
VirtuaWin version 3.0 or above.


Installation:

In the 'Arrange Icons By' desktop  sub-menu, disable 'Auto Arrange' and 'Align
to Grid'.

Copy  VWDesktopIcons.exe  or  VWDesktopIcons_unicode.exe  into  the  VirtuaWin
modules directory.


Configuration:

To configure a desktop's icons:

1.  Use normal VirtuaWin navigation to go to the required desktop
2.  Using  the  VirtuaWin  Setup ->  Modules ->  Configure  button to open the
    VWDesktopIcons configuration dialog 
3.  To hide an icon,  select  the icon from the right  'shown'  list and press
    Hide button to move them to the left 'hidden' list.
4.  Use the Show  button  to move an icon that has been  hidden  back into the
    shown list.
5.  Pressing  the  Reset  button  will  make all icons  visible  and set their
    position to their default Windows location.
6.  When the 'Show new icons on this desktop'  checkbox is disabled, new icons
    created on other desktops will not be shown on the current desktop.
7.  When the  'Auto-up-date  this  desktop'  checkbox is disabled  the current
    desktop will not be  automatically  up-dated on a desktop change (i.e. the
    icon layout is fixed). If enabled the  position of icons is  automatically
    updated. 
8.  The Store button can be used to store the current  position of all visible
    icons, this button must be used to change icon  positions when the current
    desktop is not automatically up-dated.
9.  The Copy and Paste buttons can be used to copy the icon configuration from
    one desktop to another. 
10. Once the Shown and Hidden lists are correct press OK.
